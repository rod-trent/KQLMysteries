# The KQL Mysteries

Welcome to the collateral repository for The KQL Mysteries series

The KQL Mysteries is a fun, fictional story but with real-world educational impact. A new, continuing way to learn KQL and expert approaches to security threats. Maybe you can help solve each mystery before Jon Block does or maybe you can detect when our hero does the wrong thing. Stay tuned...new chapters weekly.
